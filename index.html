                                    <p>
                                        In Spring quarter 2023, I was able to successfully plan and execute an attack against my cybersecurity professor where I coerce my professor. 
                                        For this attack, I created a convincing replica of a student orgainization's webpage which lead to a clone of our schools SSO login page to view the full site.
                                        Beyond the technical proficiency required for this attack, I also needed to develop a strong understanding of social engineering to convince the professor 
                                        to follow through the attack himself. Leveraging my social engineering skills, I was able to engage my professor in a conversation regarding the controversial 
                                        organization, which led him to check out the replica website I directed him to. Once here, the site seamlessly redirected to my malicious SSO page inorder to view 
                                        recorded content supposedly hosted on our schools learning management system. My professor quickly entered his school credentials into the malicious site, which 
                                        I could have saved for future attacks. This project taught me the importance of social engineering as well as technical competence needed for an adversary to carry 
                                        out a successful attack. You can view the fake SSO page <a target="_blank" href="#">here</a>.

                                <p>In this project, I worked with a team to develop a Java-based multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game following the provided
                                    Tic-Tac-Toe RFC. Utilizing a server-client architecture, players were able to connect seamlessly from multiple platforms 
                                    to host and play games and ensure universal compatibility. We were able to implement many user-friendly features, such as 
                                    game session management, real-time move updates, and game result notifications. Check out our Tic-Tac-Toe game <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/zkornas/TicTacToeRFC">here</a>!
